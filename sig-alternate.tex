\begin{abstract}
Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a mode of testing which has gained increasing popularity over the past years (economic purposes): it selects the questions asked to the examinee in order to value her level very effectively, by using her answers to the previous questions.
Traditionally, CAT systems have been relying on Item Response Theory (IRT) in order to provide an effective measure of a latent ability in large-scale assessments.
Recent work in the field of psychometrics have enlightened the need of cognitive diagnosis models, incorporating examinee skills in order to provide useful feedback. Those have been extensively studied in the literature and mostly rely on q-matrices.
In this paper, we propose a new framework for evaluating adaptive testing algorithms and use it to compare both the latent trait model using IRT and the cognitive diagnosis model using q-matrices.
We found that q-matrices perform better on both simulated data and real data.

\section{Introduction}

\alert{Contexte : Increasing access to quality education is a global issue, and one of the most exciting developments in recent years has been the introduction of MOOCs -- massively online open courses, in which hundreds or thousands of students take a course online. While this works wonderfully for lectures, assessment in the form of quizzes and exams presents some significant challenges. (Plagiat.)} We focus on binary questions (correct or incorrect).

\alert{CAT.} Let us consider a test composed of binary questions. If we already have a gigantic database of who answered what, it is natural to wonder which questions bring the most information about an examinee, i.e. if there is a ``best sequence'' according to which the questions should be asked. In oral examinations, the examiner picks the next question to ask according to the past performance of the examinee. CAT can be seen as automated version of this process.

\alert{Framework.} If the examinee behaves typically, a subset of results may be enough to guess how she will perform on the rest of the questions, using common response patterns. We can then.

\alert{IRT.}

\alert{Q-matrix.}






%This is the idea behind item response theory. Users are modeled by a latent parameter $\theta$ called \emph{ability}, which enables the estimation of probability response items. % flou
%Throughout the test, the question that will bring the most information about $\theta$ according to some criteria is asked to the examinee. Thus, a confidence interval around $\theta$ is devised and tightened. % TODO

%A q-matrix is a model link between competences and results. skills required to answer. We can try to guess the state in which the examinee is in asking the good questions. For example, 011, 010 will be less informative than 110. Thus we maintain a probability distribution, updated according to a Bayesian rule.

%Recent work tend to infer such q-matrices from student data~\cite{Desmarais2011}. Based on this structure, it is possible to refine an estimation of a newcomer's skills, according to her answers. Indeed, according to the presupposed state of a newcomer's current skills, it is interesting to pick the question that will bring the most information about her true skills.

\subsection{Our contribution}

This paper compares the IRT approach to the Q-matrix approach.

\subsection{Outline}

We will first present both models, explain how they allow us to build a test satisfying our needs, then how they behave differently on simulated data and real data.

\section{Background and Related Work}

An adaptive is seen the following way: we ask a subset of questions, thus we have an estimation of the parameters of our model which allows to infer probability for all items that remain in our bank.

We present here two models that allow us to predict performance.

The first model relies on the assumption that all questions are pairwise independent, while the second one tends to capture dependence between questions.

\subsection{Computerized adaptive testing}

In a computerized adaptive test (CAT), the examinee is presented with adaptively selected questions according to her previous performance. Thus, a CAT framework relies on two main subroutines:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsc{NextItem} : the item selection algorithm, that will pick the next question to ask according to the previous answers;
\item \textsc{TerminationRule} : a condition that will end the test, when enough information has been gathered and the competence has been measured satisfyingly.
\end{itemize}

The framework of a CAT can be represented by the following algorithm.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption*{\textbf{Computerized Adaptive Testing Framework}}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Test}{}
\State $i \gets 0$
\While{\textsc{TerminationRule} is not satisfied}
	\State $q_{i + 1} \gets \Call{NextItem}{q_1, r_1, \ldots, q_i, r_i, parameters}$
	\State Ask question $q_{i + 1}$ to the examinee
	\State Get reply $r_{i + 1}$
	\State Update $parameters$ accordingly
\EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Item Response Theory}

Item Response Theory (IRT) was first designed as a tool to detect \alert{TODOref} poor quality items in tests by establishing a link between difficulty of items and ability of contestants. It gained interest for computerized adaptive testing and several methods were proposed and implemented for the next item criterion. 
For our needs, it features a commonly used model allowing to compute the probability item response.

Basically, IRT estimate the ability of a student by a unique real number $\theta$ and characterize each question by two real numbers:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{difficulty} $d$, corresponding to the required ability for answering the question correctly; % FIX-MOI ÇA STP TMTC
\item the \emph{discrimination} $\delta$, representing the capacity of the question to distinguish between students that have the required ability from the other ones.
\end{itemize}

Knowing the ability $\theta$ of a given student and both the difficulty $d$ and the discrimination parameter $\delta$ of a given question, the model allows us to compute the probability of this student correctly answering this question:
\[ \Pr\{success\} = \frac1{1+e^{\delta(\theta - d)}} \]

The challenge is to determine the parameters that fit the most the student data.

\alert{Évaluer des étudiants efficacement et le choix principal de modèle pour computerized adaptive testing}

\alert{Related work à propos des selection criteria}

A key algorithm lies within the item selection process, we want to select the best question according to a certain criteria, that will allow us to narrow at best the confidence interval around $\theta$.

\subsection{Cognitive Diagnosis Model}

\alert{À l'origine diagnostic, feedback, à partir d'avis d'experts}

Instead of a summative score, people can receive a profile, specifying which skills are mastered and which ones are not~\cite{Cheng2009}. \alert{Exemples concrets de skills [Huebner]}

Let us assume there are $K$ different skills. A user can be modeled by a binary vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_K$, called \emph{state}, representing her master of the different skills. 

\alert{Liens entre questions et compétences item-to-skill [Desmarais]}

A $q$-matrix \cite{Takaoka} represents, for each question, the different skills required to answer the question. $Q_{ij}$ is equal to 1 if the skill $j$ is required to solve the question $i$, 0 otherwise. We consider here the DINA model~\cite{Desmarais2012}, where a student will answer correctly a question if and only if she has all the required skills. For example, in the following q-matrix, skills 1 and 2 are required to answer the first question, skills 1 and 3 for the second question and only skill 3 for last question. % Il y a aussi d'autres trucs
\[ Q = \left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right) \]

\alert{Il existe d'autres approches : il faut un seul skill parmi ceux demandés pour répondre correctement, plus des skills sont maitrisés plus la probabilité de répondre correctement est élevée, certains considèrent des états d'apprentissage intermédiaires (0, 1/2, 1) ou l'ajout de paramètres slip and guessing. }

\alert{Pour chaque user, il y a $2^K$ états possibles. On maintient pour chacun une distribution de probabilité sur les états (donc $2^K$ réels) ~\cite{Huebner2010}.}

\alert{Connaissant une distribution de probabilité, il est facile d'estimer la probabilité de répondre aux questions. L'update de l'état est fait via la formule de Bayes}

\alert{Formule de Bayes}

\alert{Exemples avec $K = 3$}

\alert{Lorsque des experts fixent cette q-matrice, on peut donner un feedback explicite, mais ici on s'intéresse seulement à prédire les résultats. On peut donc se libérer de cette contrainte de q-matrice imposée et en calculer une qui colle au mieux aux données}

\alert{Néanmoins : determine q-matrix from student data is currently an open field of research}

\section{Our Test Framework}

Our student data is a binary matrix contestants $\times$ questions where $c_{ij}$ is 1 if contestant $i$ answered the question $j$, 0 otherwise.

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1. Train with subset of student data
\item Step 2. Choose next item
\item Step 3. Update parameters accordingly
\item Step 4. Compute probability and error
\end{itemize}

Steps 2 and 3 are repeated $b$ times, where $b$ represents the \emph{budget}.

\subsection{Item Response Theory}

\begin{itemize}
\item Step 1. Determine difficulties, discrimination parameter and the ability $\theta$ of each student
\item Step 2. We chose the Minimum Expected Posterior Variance criterion, which corresponds to minimizing the entropy of the distribution
\item Step 3. Bayesian update of $\theta^*$
\item Step 4. Compute probability and error
\end{itemize}

\alert{Précalcul des paramètres}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption*{\textbf{Adaptive testing using IRT}}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Test}{}
\While{$entropy(\pi) > threshold$}
	\State Pick a question
	\State Update $\pi$
\EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption*{\textbf{Adaptive testing using Q-matrix}}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Test}{}
\While{$entropy(\pi) > threshold$}
	\State Pick a question
	\State Update $\pi$
\EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We used cross-validation to compare those scenarios.
