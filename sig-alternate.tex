\section{Introduction}

Nowadays machin

Let us consider a test composed of multiple-choice questions. If we already have a gigantic database of who answered what, it is natural to wonder which questions bring the most information about an examinee, of if there is a ``best sequence'' according to which the questions should be asked. % process in an interview

Indeed, if the examinee behaves typically, a subset of results may be enough to guess how she will perform on the rest of the questions, using common response patterns.

This is the idea behind item response theory. Users are modeled by a latent parameter $\theta$ called \emph{ability}, which enables the estimation of probability response items. % flou
Throughout the test, the question that will bring the most information about $\theta$ according to some criteria is asked to the examinee. Thus, a confidence interval around $\theta$ is devised and tightened. % TODO

A q-matrix is a model link between competences and results. skills required to answer. We can try to guess the state in which the examinee is in asking the good questions. For example, 011, 010 will be less informative than 110. Thus we maintain a probability distribution, updated according to a Bayesian rule.

Recent work tend to infer such q-matrices from student data~\cite{Desmarais2011}. Based on this structure, it is possible to refine an estimation of a newcomer's skills, according to her answers. Indeed, according to the presupposed state of a newcomer's current skills, it is interesting to pick the question that will bring the most information about her true skills.

\subsection{Our contribution}

This paper compares the IRT approach to the Q-matrix approach.

\subsection{Outline}

We will first present both models, explain how they allow us to build a test satisfying our needs, then how they behave differently on simulated data and real data.

\section{Background and Related Work}

An adaptive is seen the following way: we ask a subset of questions, thus we have an estimation of the parameters of our model which allows to infer probability for all items that remain in our bank.

We present here two models that allow us to predict performance.

The first model relies on the assumption that all questions are pairwise independent, while the second one tends to capture dependence between questions.

\subsection{Computerized adaptive testing}

Item selection rule. Termination rule.

\subsection{Item Response Theory}

% Génèse IRT
% Déceler des mauvais tests génèrent un comportement inhabituel des étudiants

% Bon modèle pour prévoir la probabilité

Basically, we estimate the ability of a student by a unique real number $\theta$ and characterize each question by two real numbers:

\begin{itemize}
\item the \emph{difficulty} $d$, corresponding to the required ability for answering the question correctly; % FIX-MOI ÇA STP TMTC
\item the \emph{discrimination} $\delta$, representing the capacity of the question to distinguish between students that have the required ability from the other ones.
\end{itemize}

Knowing the ability $\theta$ of a given student and both the difficulty $d$ and the discrimination parameter $\delta$ of a given question, the model allows us to compute the probability of this student correctly answering this question:
\[ \Pr\{success\} = \frac1{1+e^{\delta(\theta - d)}} \]

The challenge is to determine the parameters that fit the most the student data.

% Évaluer des étudiants efficacement et le choix principal de modèle pour computerized adaptive testing

% Related work à propos des selection criteria

A key algorithm lies within the item selection process, we want to select the best question according to a certain criteria, that will allow us to narrow at best the confidence interval around $\theta$.

\subsection{Cognitive Diagnosis Model}

% À l'origine diagnostic, feedback, à partir d'avis d'experts

Instead of a summative score, people can receive a profile, specifying which skills are mastered and which ones are not~\cite{Cheng2009}. % Exemples de skills [Huebner]

Let us assume there are $K$ different skills. A user can be modeled by a binary vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_K)$, called \emph{state}, representing her master of the different skills. % Exemple de vecteur

% Liens entre questions et compétences item-to-skill [Desmarais]

A $q$-matrix \cite{Takaoka} represents, for each question, the different skills required to answer the question. $Q_{ij}$ is equal to 1 if the skill $j$ is required to solve the question $i$, 0 otherwise. We consider here the DINA model~\cite{Desmarais2012}, where a student will answer correctly a question if and only if she has all the required skills. For example, in the following q-matrix, skills 1 and 2 are required to answer the first question. % Il y a aussi d'autres trucs
\[ Q = \left(\begin{array}{lll}
1 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right) \]

% Modulo two parameters called slip and guessing.
