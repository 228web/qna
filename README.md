# Comparing models for adaptive testing

Comparing Rasch, DINA, MIRT, GenMA presented at the EC-TEL 2016 conference.

You first need to install [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) for Python 2.7. ``pypy`` is optional but I strongly suggest it for the DINA model, which is pretty slow to train.

As scikit-learn relies on scipy, you may need [gfortran](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/macosx.html#compilers-c-c-fortran-cython) as well.

    $ mkdir backup
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ . venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This code also relies on R packages, that you will have to install:

- ltm
- catR
- CDM
- mirt
- mirtCAT

## Troubleshooting

You may need to do the following while installing RPy: ``apt-get install libreadline-dev liblzma-dev python-tk``.

## Usage

Either you try a ``./start.sh tmp``, or you check the ``start.sh`` file.

The default ``conf.py`` file is in ``DEBUG`` mode, which means it focuses on making an adaptive test on only one student. You can change it by setting the ``DEBUG`` parameter to ``False``.

- Rasch: 3s
- DINA 8-dim: 40s or 8s using pypy
- MIRT 2-dim: 20s
- GenMA 8-dim: 95s
